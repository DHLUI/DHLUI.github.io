        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="hello-i-am-hanlin-dai">Hello, I am Hanlin Dai</h1>
<p>You can also call me Herring, that's my english name. I graduated from Zhejiang University - City College in 2014. My major is electronic information engineering, and i participated in some college research projects during the university time. Such as   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch#:~:text=10%20External%20links-,Definition,of%20contact%20with%20the%20surface.">Multi-Touch</a>   &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freescale_Semiconductor">Freescale Smart car </a>  , I joined a student research organization called “Debug” and make some projects though programming via Single-Chip Microcomputer.</p>

<h1 id="about-design">About design</h1>
<p>I got in touch with 3D design during my senior year in university, I am totally obsessed with a design software called 3D max！I started to learn knowledge of design with teachers from creative college in our university.</p>
<p><strong>Early self-study works during university time</strong></p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://DHLUI.github.io/post-images/1613224973711.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Oh! that is really great software!  After that,  I opened the door to design, I prefer design to hardware programming  (aha~emmm～🤔Maybe just because design is easier than programming). But to be honest, I love design &amp; create.</p>
<p>After graduating from university, I got in touch the internet industry, working in the internet industry as a UX designer. In these years of work, I have served different companies and products. I am very grateful for the help that my former team gave me.😘</p>
<p><strong>Below are some companies that I have served before</strong></p>
